# What Makes a UFC Winner?
Based on my research, the factors below are listed in order of importance that signify someone will win their UFC match:

1. Market closing odds
    - Difference in odds between fighters, underdog/favourite flags
2. Style & matchup
    - Significant strikes landed
    - Takedowns landed / accuracy
    - Takedown defense
    - Control time
    - Submission attempts
    
    *Generally consider offensive metrics per minute, defensive metrics, and strike differential (landed - absorbed)*
3. Consider cardio pairup
    - Strikes attempted per minute
    - Takedowns per minute
    - Average fight length
    - A 3-5 round fighter or mainly a 1 round fighter?
4. Durability and damage absorption
    - Strikes absorbed per minute
    - Knockdown rate
    - KO/TKO losses
    - Number of KO losses (especially recently)
5. Age / How recently they last fought
    - Older fighters with heavier "mileage" tend ot underperform
    - Age
    - Age difference between fighters
    - Total fights
    - Total rounds / cage time 
    - KO losses count / recency
6. Size, reach, weight cutting
    - Reach difference
    - True size
    - Missed weight recently?
    - Short-notice / up-weight-class replacement

## My Implementation Priority List
1. First Wave
    - Basic record and recent form (win streaks, recent finishes, KO losses)
    - General performance metrics (sig strikes landed/absorbed per minute, takedown attempts and accuracy, TDD, control time, submission attempts)
2. Second Wave
    - Closing betting odds / implied win probability
    - Age and age difference
    - Total rounds / cage time
    - Style and how they interact with one another
    - Cardio comparisons
3. Third Wave
    - Reach and height difference
    - Weight class changes / missed weight / short notice
